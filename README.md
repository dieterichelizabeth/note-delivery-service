Challenge 11 Express.js: Note Taker

[Click to view the deployed application!](https://nameless-spire-63081.herokuapp.com/)

Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. A user can open the application, and click on the link to the notes page. On load of the notes page, the user can see previous notes (if applicable) in the left-hand collumn. Then the user can type a new note by adding the note's title and text. Pressing the "save" icon will store your note to the json file, and the application will display your saved note on the left hand collumn of the page.

Users can access their previous notes by clicking on any of the notes in the left hand collumn, and the note will display on the right-hand collumn. If the user wants to add another note while viewing a past note, clicking the "+" icon at the top of the screen will present fields for a new note. Users can delete previous notes by clicking the "delete" button on notes in the left-hand collumn. The application uses an Express.js back end, and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

For this challenge, the application’s front end has already been created. Our job was to build the back end, connect the two, and deploy the entire app to Heroku.
